Regardless of your view or opinion it would be more fair to compare the Russian FB ad buy to Clinton's FB ad buy. ... or better yet how much was spent by a foreign adversarial government on pro-Trump ads vs. how much was spent by a foreign adversarial government on pro-Hillary ads?

Why should any institution tolerate hate speech?? People have the right to do lots of disgusting dangerous self destructive stuff but there are boundaries social norms acceptable limits.. Its not simply 'shutting down' those that disagree.. Its shutting down 'hate speech'.. Its like inciting a riot its illegal to incite violence.. What good can come of hate speech?? Should it be protected just for 'protection' sake?? The Nazi KKK tiki torch parade in Charolettsville resulted in an innocent death of a protester.. Even through Trump concluded there were some 'fine folks' there nobody outside the 'alt right' agrees.. Just like the supreme court ruled a cake maker can refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple cant a university refuse to provide a platform for hate speech??

If we start arguing with people that say money is free speech we might ask which currency they are talking in say dollars or rubles or even petro-dollars.  And 'speaking money' quickly becomes dominant over Nations which I believe is exactly what is taking place.  In my book 'talking money' and 'universal treason against all Nation States' merge into one international crime syndicate of the ultra rich.  My conclusion: Talking money in politics is by definition treason.

BUT over the years banks began increasing fees for their use; and having one requires a bank account and banks require minimums or there are high fees for not meeting the minimum and a person needs two pieces of ID and a good credit check. ALL of which reduced the numbers of people eligible for bank accounts and debit/credit cards. If you ever go to a gas station notice how many still go into the store to pay in cash. Notice how much cash is still used at the grocery store or Target. Until everyone is allowed to have an account without fees and minimums we cannot  become a cashless society."

I'm not against unions but when they are convincing workers to vote against their own interests and workers feel they can't strike even if they want to because they need any income they can get something is broken.

The Italian Draghi has printed (sorry created new money) through QE and other equivalents to 2 Trillion. The Euro zone nominal GDP at 2016 was 10 trillion. That means that 20% of NEW money has been created. In exchange to 20%/GDP of new money the Euro zone has had a pathetic growth of 1-2%. If this is not one of the ridiculous solutions for growth ever. The EU started as a free trade area and a customs union. Over time it has become a supranational entity that resembles a federal state and is governed by a byzantine bureaucracy in Brussels. The EU claims to have brought about prosperity and stability in Europe but those claims are increasingly at odds with reality. Europe is becoming worryingly unstable and is falling behind other regions in terms of economic growth prosperity justice and lack of democracy. The EU model which is marked by overregulation and centralization seems increasingly out of place in today’s world. What European countries need in the coming decades is openness rather than regional protectionism and flexibility rather than overregulation from Brussels. Above all what European governments need to do is to reconnect with their increasingly restless electorates rather than ignore the latter for the sake of the unwanted undemocratic goal of a European superstate. However thank to incompetents like Juncker they have more superstate and the loss of the second more important country in the union.

Why should older workers retire earlier?  They might still have a lot to contribute and are living longer.  Forcing workers to retire earlier creates a ""doughnut hole"" between retirement age and age 70 when SS benefits are highest.
